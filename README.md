## Getting Started (Locally)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alseals1/Blog.git

```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=mypassword123
DB_NAME=blog
```

### 4. Run migrations & seeds

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

### 5. Start backend locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6. Start frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
