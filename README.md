## Getting Started (Locally)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alseals1/Blog.git
cd Blog/backend
```

### 2. Start MySQL via Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d mysql
```

This spins up a MySQL container, mapped to `localhost:3307`.

### 3. Setup `.env` (Optional for config.js users)

```env
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3307
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=mypassword123
DB_NAME=blog
```

### 4. Run migrations & seeds

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

### 5. Start backend locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6. Start frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
